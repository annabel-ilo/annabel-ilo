# Having the skill to build mobile applocation is a dream come true to me.
Here are some ideas to get you started on knowing me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m actively working on a project that will improve social and financial management by younger adults. The project is not a personal application, so i cannot share more information. It's an exiting project and i am proud to being a part of the developers. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m studying Cloud Engineering with focus towards AWS, [with AltSchool of Engineering Africa](https://www.altschoolafrica.com/#) . This is an exiting and challenging journey, and i hope to share the success story soon.
- ðŸ¤” Connecting and collaborating with developers is an idea i am always open to. The flutter community is most welcoming and i'm proud to be apart of it. You never know, we may become the next big thing.
